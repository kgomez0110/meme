Winner of Best Use of Snap Kit at Uncommon Hacks 2019.



## Inspiration
I've seen fun websites like this in the past but never a website that could generate based off of user input. 

## What it does
Takes in two user images and a sound from a soundboard to make a fun little app where users can click around.

## How we built it
Lots and lots of debugging node.js and javascript as well as formatting HTML and CSS by hand to make it look nice.

## Challenges we ran into
learning how to utilize node.js, domain hosting

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making a website that'll be fun to play with it even after the hackathon is over. We're definitely sharing this with our friends!

## What We Learned
the struggle of hosting a website (thank you for the gcloud credit!), how to make good memes at 3 in the morning, node.js, snapkit

## What's Next
updating certificates for memerdreamr.com, allowing audio files to be uploaded rather than chosen from a soundboard, more sounds on the soundboard
